            <div class="content2"> Nadan Kozhi Varuthathu, also known as Kerala Style Chicken Fry, is a delightful dish for meat lovers.This is one chicken recipe that my entire family loves and keep asking for.The best part of this recipe is it doesn’t need more oil and tastes too good..It can be made as a side dish, or as the star player. Either way, this chicken fry is super easy  to work with and when done, it is perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy inside. It pairs well with Rice, Roti’s, Kerala Parotta, etc or enjoy as an snack.

            <div class="content4">Thalassery biryani originated from the malabar region of Kerala and is quite popular for its unique aroma and taste that comes from the unusual variety of rice called Jeerakasala. Unlike the other kind of popular biryanis where basmati rice is used, thalassery biriyani is made using a premium quality short grain rice which is also known as kaima rice or biriyani rice in Kerala.
                Biryani masala made from a unique blend of kerala spices is another contributor to one of this most amazing & flavorful biriyani. If you are not accessible to the jeerakasala rice, then you may try this with aged basmati rice.
