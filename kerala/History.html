                    Kerala, known as “God’s Own Country,” has a history that dates back over a thousand years. It was first mentioned as “Cheras” (Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. 
                    The Cheras transformed Kerala into an international trade center, engaging in commerce across the Arabian Sea with Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Eastern African ports. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara, a prominent philosopher, was born in Kerala. 
                    The region saw European influences through Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama’s sea route to Kozhikode in 1498. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama, made significant contributions, including the discovery of infinite series and calculus foundations.</div>

            <div class="content 1"> The palace was built and gifted by the Portuguese as a present to the king of Cochin, around 1545. It was built to appease the king after they plundered a temple nearby. The landing of Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese explorer,
                 at Kappad in 1498 was welcomed by the Kochi rulers. The Portuguese were given exclusive right to construct factories and they repulsed the repeated attacks of the Zamorians, and the Cochin Rajas practically became vassals of the Portuguese. The influence of the Portuguese was supplanted by the Dutch,
                  and they took over Mattancherry in 1663. Subsequently, the area was taken over by Hyder Ali and still later by the British East India Company.</div>

                Jatayu Earth Center, also known as Jatayu Nature Park or Jatayu Rock, is a park and tourism centre at Chadayamangalam in Kollam district of Kerala, India. It stands at an altitude of 350m (1200ft) above the mean sea level. Jatayu Nature Park holds the distinction of having the world’s largest bird sculpture, which is of Jatayu.
                According to the epic, Ravana was attempting to abduct Sita to Lanka when Jatayu tried to rescue her. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old Ravana soon defeated him, clipping his wings, and Jatayu fell onto the rocks in Chadayamangalam. Rama and Lakshmana while on the search for Sita, chanced upon the stricken and dying Jatayu, who informed them of the battle with Ravana and told them that Ravana had headed South.
