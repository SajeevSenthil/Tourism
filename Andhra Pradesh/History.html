                    The recorded history of Andhra Pradesh, one of the 28 states of 21st-century India, begins in the Vedic period. It is mentioned in Sanskrit epics such as the Aitareya Brahmana (800 BCE). Its sixth-century BCE incarnation, Assaka, lay between the Godavari and Krishna Rivers, 
                    making it one of the sixteen mahajanapadas (700–300 BCE). Over time, various dynasties flourished in the region, including the Satavahanas, Kakatiyas, and Vijayanagara Empire. Andhra Pradesh has a rich historical legacy that has shaped its culture and identity</div>
